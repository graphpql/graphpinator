:zap::globe_with_meridians::zap: Easy-to-use & Fast GraphQL server implementation for PHP.

## Introduction

Feature complete PHP implementation of GraphQL server. Its job is transformation of query string into resolved Json result for a given Schema. 

- Aims to be compliant with the latest draft of GraphlQL specification.
- Includes some opt-in extensions which are out of scope of official specs, such as custom scalars or constraint directives.
- Fully typesafe, and therefore minimum required PHP version is 7.4+.

```composer require infinityloop-dev/graphpinator```
